Day 1
Numpy stands for numerical python. It works primarly with numerical data that is stored as a multi dimensional array data structure. 
Array - Array is like a grid, if that is a one dimensional array, is pretty much like a list and just like a list, it's ordered mutable and enclosed in square brackets.
Array of values needs to be of the same data type. [1,2,3,4]
A two dimensional array is like a list of lists.
It can be referred to as a matrix. Matrices are arranged in rows and columns. Two dimensional arrays have two axes.
[1,2,3]
[4,5,6]
Two dimensional arrays have two axes. The zero axis is in the direction of the rows and the one axis is in the direction of the columns.
Numpy has more mathematical and computation abilities compare to list. 
Converting list into numpy array
list = [2,4,6,8]
import numpy as np
np.array(object,dtype) --> np.array(list)
np.shape(list)
Numpy array --> np.array([1,1,1,1])
Tuple to array --> np.array((1,2,3))
For set we have to convert it into list before converting into array.
arrat2D = ([[2,4,6], [8,10,12]])
2D array fro, list 
list1  = [1,2,3]
list2 = [4,5,6]
np.array([list1,list2])
np.array([list1,list2],dtype=longdouble)
np.array([list1,list2],dtype='g') long double offers a higher degree of precision.
